# Candyland

## Description
This is a game where the objective is to reach the end of a board. Each space on the board has a color, and your movement through the board is determined by cards that have colors on them. In general, you move to the next instance of the color on the card you drew. However, you can move further ahead (or even in reverse) if you draw card that's specially marked "candycane" or "gumdrop". Also, if you land on a board space marked "sticky", then you lose your next turn.

## How to Play
